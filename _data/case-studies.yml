      description: Imagining how to display all of the relevant information about not just one but multiple vehicles in a way the user could quickly understand was the most challenging task of the competition. I used a series of icons, as well as colors, to represent the various states that a vehicle can have. The outliner also contains controls for affecting each vehicle's basic flight operations.

      description: The details panel condenses a wealth of vehicle information into an easy-to-navigate window. Users can quickly see focused vehicle information and controls by switching between the tabbed interface. Each tab icon also corresponds to an alert icon in the outliner.

      description: The mission timeline displays a representation of a vehicle's progress through a planned mission.

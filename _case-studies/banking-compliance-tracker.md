  - title: User Story Map
    description: >-
      We started the design sprint by using a user story map to discover key
      content areas. This method also helps us to prioritize critical activities
      in the user group's workflow.

  - title: UI Flow Outline
    description: >-
      By taking the activities outlined in the user story map, we can use a UI
      flow outline to group actions into pages with which the user will
      interact. This exercise helps us understand how the UI will be stitched
      together. These lists can also act as a checklist as we begin to draw out
      the screens. This ensured that users have access to critical features in
      the early stages of the design.

  - title: Strategic Dashboard
    description: >-
      This high-level dashboard outlines all of the key performance indicators
      for the organization. Executives can quickly see progress in critical
      areas and if anything needs special attention. It also provides a look
      into ongoing projects so that users can drill down into lower levels of
      information.

  - title: KPI Category Overview
    description: >-
      Each KPI category can have serval projects all going on simultaneously.
      This overview page shows executives how their projects fit together on a
      timeline. This allows for strategic insights that otherwise would never be
      possible.

  - title: Project Details Page
    description: >-
      The project detail page is the central hub of activity. Here we capture
      the workflow for the project and give managers an excellent view of
      current progress and recommendations for how to respond if issues pop up.

  - title: Project Gantt View
    description: >-
      The Gantt view visualizes how tasks across projects are related to one
      another. This help to improve collaboration between departments and
      provide valuable foresight.

  - title: Project List View
    description: >-
      The list view is data-rich, giving managers a complete list of all tasks
      that must be completed during a given project. No more paper checklists;
      this list is all managers need to stay on track and stay up to date in
      real time.

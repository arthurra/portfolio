  - title: user flow diagram
    description: >-
      We began by mapping out the key content areas based on our target
      audience's needs. We identified each action that any of our user groups
      would need to make on each content block; and where that action would take
      them, allowing us to lay the foundation for a robust and efficient system.

  - title: low fidelity wireframes
    description: >-
      Here we block out the elements on the page to add some visuals to the
      screens described in our user flow diagram. Creating low-fidelity versions
      of what we think the page will look like allows us to test our assumptions
      and have better conversations about what we need to see on the screen.

      Adding detail and stitching the screens together helps to make the
      experience start to feel real. We keep the flow through the system in mind
      as we refine individual pages. At this stage, we can test for usability
      and efficiency.

  - title: high fidelity prototype
    description: >-
      The high-fidelity prototype is the final stage in our UX design sprint. It
      combines the effective layouts of our wireframes with added style, visual
      hierarchy, and iconography. Next, it's time for us to take what we've
      learned and start building.

      Groups of products, requests, and quotes, can be easily organized into
      projects. From here, users can quickly see all the most up-to-date
      information without searching through multiple files. They can save time
      and take the guesswork out of the equation.

  - title: quote details
    description: >-
      The quote builder/quote details page displays products alongside equipment
      tags and allows vendors to add custom line items to meet customer needs.

  - title: project pricing table
    description: >-
      Big projects can have a multitude of products coming from different
      vendors across several product categories. Our design makes it easy to see
      the breakdown of each offer so that users can make the best decision for
      their project.

      The UI is divided into several flexible tiled windows to enhance the
      user's focus. All the windows are interconnected but are specialized to
      show specific vehicle information. Together they provide a complete
      picture of how the vehicles are operating.

      Imagining how to display all of the relevant information about not just
      one but multiple vehicles in a way the user could quickly understand was
      the most challenging task of the competition. I used a series of icons, as
      well as colors, to represent the various states that a vehicle can have.
      The outliner also contains controls for affecting each vehicle's basic
      flight operations.

      The details panel condenses a wealth of vehicle information into an
      easy-to-navigate window. Users can quickly see focused vehicle information
      and controls by switching between the tabbed interface. Each tab icon also
      corresponds to an alert icon in the outliner.

      The mission timeline displays a representation of a vehicle's progress
      through a planned mission. It also serves a dual purpose of graphically
      showing the vehicle altitude that can't be seen on the top-down map. The
      user can scrub through the timeline to see recorded or estimated spacial
      information to plan or review a mission.

      The map shows where the vehicles are in space. Several other components
      are overlayed on top of the map view. The toolbar along the left edge of
      the map contains all the tools for selecting and affecting vehicle
      operation. The traffic view window serves as a minimap with a simplified
      high-contrast view of vehicle positions. The camera window displays a
      stream from the selected vehicle's camera.

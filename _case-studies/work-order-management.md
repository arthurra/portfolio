  - title: jobs list
    description: >-
      The jobs list helps users keep track of everything that's going on.
      Finding any job or group of jobs quickly by easily filtering or sorting
      the list helps plant managers save time and keep everything organized.

  - title: new job form
    description: >-
      What was a complicated process with lots of paperwork became one
      easy-to-use form. Capturing this data early was crucial for a smooth
      workflow down that line. We only ask for a few essential details up front
      and even make suggestions to make the process quick and easy. Suggesting
      recently used data to the user helps reduce cognitive load and saves time
      on looking up contact details already in the system.

    description: >-
      Every job has a lot of moving parts. Here we can track all of the products
      that this job is for during the lifecycle of the job. Workers across
      several departments all see the same information at the same time,
      allowing them to work simultaneously. Users can add and update information
      as it comes in so that no one ever misses a beat.

  - title: job progress
    description: >-
      Products in a job could be split up across several work orders. This was
      especially difficult for managers to keep track of and optimize for.
      Visualizing how each product is distributed made it much easier to keep
      jobs organized and troubleshoot any potential bottlenecks.

  - title: job history
    description: >-
      Access to accurate metrics is essential to ensuring everything is running
      smoothly. The status history visually represents when a job has progressed
      past each checkpoint. Seeing the timeline helps to evaluate the job
      process and identify opportunities to optimize.

  - title: production queue
    description: >-
      What was spread out across numerous paper workbooks is now consolidated
      into one easy to, easy to access queue. The new production queue provides
      accuracy and reliability for all machines running in multiple plants.

      Technicians used to flip through manuals to calibrate machines properly
      for different processes throughout the day. By digitizing the
      specifications, we can deliver real-time product-specific data to the
      techs.

  - title: work order production summary
    description: >-
      Each work order's results are recorded and easily accessible for review.
      Every report can be easily printed and is formatted to look great so that
      it can be sent to clients.
